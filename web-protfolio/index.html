        <h3>I am mountain biker</h3>
        <p1>On Saturday morning, May 15th, more than 50 riders packed into the small parking lot at Clay County Choppers in Claycomo, Missouri to help kick off their grand opening. There were many great specials throughout the store, and Julie, the eye-popping, bikini-clad Easyriders® Magazine April Fox Hunt winner, posed on customers bikes and autographed photos. Julie is scheduled to appear on the cover of Easyriders Magazine this fall, so make sure to watch your newsstands.</p1>

            <h2 >My Dream</h2>
            <p1>It’s hard to put into words what cycling does for your soul. I’m sure anyone who is passionate in any aspect of life can relate, but for me it starts with that moment I zip up my jersey and clip myself into what feels like part of me. Your bike becomes your counterpart: you hold forth your every breath into pushing it faster and further, you put all of your trust into it to sermonize your thoughts and movement. We live on the edge of a blade with every twist and turn, and yet this beautiful machine delivers what is expected. It is a part of you.
